Explanation:

The Pacman ghost controller will have a 4 buttons, each associated with a direction(up, down, left, right) since there are 4 directions that you can move to. If a directional button is pressed, it will print out the direction name associte with the button you pressed. There's going to be a motor and an LED that activates if you are dead which is for the sake of indicating the state of the player. The motor would showcase the impact death has on the ghost.
